title: Community Engagement Coffees in July
---

The commission’s Local Advisory Board and commission member Tierney
Fairchild have launched a series of Community Engagement Coffees. The
meetings seek to explore how the work of the President’s Commission on
Slavery and the University can better serve the
Charlottesville/Albemarle community. The coffees, held at [JABA’s
Vinegar Hill
Café](http://www.jabacares.org/page/full/vinegar-hill-catering/) in the
[Jefferson School City Center](http://www.jeffersoncitycenter.com/), are
free and open to the public.

Upcoming Community Engagement Coffee dates:

* Monday, July 14th at 5:00pm
* Tuesday, July 15th at 9:00am

They are also planning a larger scale Community Engagement Forum for
September—please be on the lookout for “Save the Date” information.
