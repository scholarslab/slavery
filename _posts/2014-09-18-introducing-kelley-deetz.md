title: Introducing Kelley Deetz
---

Dr. Marcus Martin and Kirt von Daacke, President’s Commission on Slavery and the University Co-Chairs, are excited to introduce the commission’s new Research Associate, Kelley Deetz.

Deetz is joining us from Roanoke College, where she was an Assistant Professor of History and the Director of the Public History Program. While at Roanoke she taught courses on Black History, developed and established the Public History Program, curated and directed museum exhibits on African American History in the Roanoke Valley, spearheaded research on the enslaved laborers who built the college, and conducted an archaeological survey of the plantation kitchen yard which is located on the campus.

Deetz holds a B.A. in Black Studies from The College of William and Mary, as well as a M.A. in African American Studies and Ph.D. in African Diaspora Studies from the University of California at Berkeley.  She specializes in nineteenth-century African American culture, African Diaspora archaeology, and public history (tourism, memorials, and memory). She is the former Vice President and current Board Member of the Legacy Museum of African American History in Lynchburg, Virginia, and the Co-Editor of the African Diaspora Archaeology Newsletter.

She is currently working on a manuscript entitled *Bound to the Fire:
Virginia's Enslaved Cooks and their Kitchens* (University of South
Carolina Press), and her forthcoming
chapter “Stolen Bodies, Edible Memories: The Influence and Function of
West African Foodways in the Early British Atlantic” will be in *The
Routledge History of Food* due for publication this Fall.  Deetz has worked extensively in Cultural Resource Management both in Virginia and in California, and was a professional cook for over a decade. She is excited to join the Commission and looks forward to working with the community to uncover the rich and complicated narratives of those who were in bondage at the University.
