            <p>Over the past decade, U.S. colleges and universities have begun paying greater attention to the historical role of slavery at their institutions. For example, Brown University’s <a
                href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/">Committee on
                Slavery and Justice</a> released an extensive report in 2006 that
            documented Brown’s history with slavery and the transatlantic
            slave trade. In 2011, Emory University hosted the first-ever
            <a href="http://transform.emory.edu/conference/">conference examining the history and legacy of slavery’s role in
                higher education</a>. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
            created a large online exhibition titled <a
                href="http://www2.lib.unc.edu/mss/exhibits/slavery/">Slavery
                and the Making of the University</a>, recognizing and documenting the contributions of slaves to the university during the antebellum period. The University of Virginia will join other premier institutions in exploring and commemorating its relationship with slavery, as well as the lives of the enslaved people who were an integral part of early life at Jefferson’s University.</p>
            <p>At an April 2013 meeting of the President’s Cabinet, Dr. Marcus
            Martin, Vice President and Chief Officer for Diversity and Equity,
            made a presentation on slavery at UVa and proposed that a
            commission be formed to further explore the topic and to make
            recommendations as to the next steps the University could take in
            response to this history.  Dr. Martin credited groups such as
            <a
                href="http://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/ucare/current-projects/memorial-for-enslaved-laborers/">Memorial
            for Enslaved Laborers</a> (MEL), the UVa IDEA (Inclusion Diversity
        Equity Access) Fund, and <a
            href="http://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/ucare/">University and Community Action for Racial
        Equity</a> (UCARE) for creating robust initiatives around the topic of
    slavery, which will guide the Commission’s work. <a
        href="http://www.virginia.edu/vpdiversity/documents/SlaveryatUVaBrochure_FINAL.pdf">Slavery
        at the University of Virginia: Visitor’s Guide</a>, a student-led
    brochure that provides visitors with information about the University’s
    history with slavery, is one such initiative. The formation of the
    President’s Commission on Slavery and the University is the next step in
    building a broader institutional effort.</p>
